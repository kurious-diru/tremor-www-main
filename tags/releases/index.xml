Summary This release is the last minor release before we start turning tremor into a truly distributed event processing and data distribution engine. We focused on small things that improve usability and ironed out some rough edges here and there.
TL;DR We extended our type system and codecs by the binary type. Elasticsearch offramp now supports Linked Transport. String interpolation done right, now with #{} instead of just {} Release now includes prebuilt binaries, DEB packages and RPMs New Release Artefacts To make your life easier installing and Tremor we added new release artefacts.</description></item><item><title>Releasing Tremor v0.9!</title><link>/blog/2020-10-16-v09-release/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Oct 2020 19:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2020-10-16-v09-release/</guid><description>Summary Tremor is an open source event processing and data distribution engine designed to interpose or intercept data in complex systems primarily to inject quality of service, correct data flows and to enrich or support complex traffic shaping, routing and load-balancing based on contextual, situational or content derived dynamic conditions.
Tremor has a powerful ETL language designed for flexibly pattern matching structured data such as JSON efficiently (SIMD-accelerated), and an easy to configure declarative flow-based SQL language designed for rich JSON-like data to describe data processing and data flow graphs with declarative QoS constraints.</description></item></channel></rss>
